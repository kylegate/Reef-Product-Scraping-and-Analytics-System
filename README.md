# Reef-Product-Scraping-and-Analytics-System
This project scrapes product data from Bulk Reef Supply's website and logs it into a local SQLite database. It tracks product details such as name, SKU, brand, and prices. The program runs weekly to monitor price changes over time and enables time series analysis for category and product-specific trends.
